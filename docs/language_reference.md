# Language reference

## Syntax
Primi is built with a familiar PHP/JS/C-like syntax. **Statements are **separated using the `;` semicolon character**. If there's no need to put multiple statements on a single line, the newline character can be used as statements' separator, too. Both of these syntaxes are therefore valid:

- Using semicolons *(recommended)*:
    ```
    a = 1 + 2; b = a + 3;
    c = b - a;
    ```

- Using newlines:
    ```
    a = 1 + 2
    b = a + 3
    c = b - a
    ```

## Data types
Primi has 5 basic data types:
- Bool
- Number
- String
- Regex
- Array

### Bool
This basic type represens a primitive boolean "truth" value. Possible values are `true` and `false`.

Example usage:
```
a = true;
b = 1 == 2; // false
c = b == false; // true
```

### Number
The general `number` data type harbors both integer and float values, whichever is needed at the time. THe maximum/minimum integer or float value/precision is determined by the version of PHP under which the Primi nterpreter runs.

Example usage:
```
a = 4 - 3; // 1
b = a / 3; // 0.333...
```

### String
This data types represents a series of characters. Multi-byte characters (accents, diacritics) are treated properly.

Example usage:
```
a = "hello";
b = "wóóórld!";
c = a + " " + b; // "hello wóóórld!"
```

### Regex
Regex data type exists for advanced string matching. It is defined between two `/` forward-slash characters and treated as PCRE (Perl-compatible) regular expressions *(the same as within PHP itself)* with Unicode mode enabled.

Example usage:
```
a = "facebook";
b = /[o]{2}.*/;
c = a == b; // true
```

### Array
Arrays are untyped *(PHP-style)* containers that can accomodate multiple values of different *(or same)* types. Array index can be optionally defined for value; integer index starting from the lowest present index found is used by default.

Example usage:
```
a = ["abc", 123, 4: true, false, /[A-Z]+/];
// Resulting array: [0: "abc", 1: 123, 4: true, 5: false, 6: /[A-Z]+/]
```
