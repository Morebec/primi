# Language reference

## Syntax
Primi is built with a familiar PHP/JS/C-like syntax. **Statements are separated using the `;` semicolon character**. If there's no need to put multiple statements on a single line, statements can be separated with newline, too. Both of these syntaxes are therefore valid:

- Using semicolons *(recommended)*:
    ```
    a = 1 + 2; b = a + 3;
    c = b - a;
    ```

- Using newlines:
    ```
    a = 1 + 2
    b = a + 3
    c = b - a
    ```

## Data types
Primi has 6 data types:
- Bool
- Number
- String
- Regex
- Array
- Function

### Bool
This basic type represents a primitive boolean "truth" value. Possible values are `true` and `false`.

Example usage:
```
a = true;
b = 1 == 2; // false
c = b == false; // true
d = c == "hello"; // ERR: Cannot compare: 'bool' and 'string' @ code: c == "hello"
e = "hello" == r"[0-9]"; // false
f = "hello" == r"l{2}"; // true
```

### Number
The general `number` data type represents both integer and float values, whichever is needed. The maximum/minimum integer or float value/precision is determined by PHP version.

Example usage:
```
a = 4 - 3; // 1
b = a / 3; // 0.333...
```

### String
This data types represents a series of characters. Multi-byte characters (accents, diacritics) are treated properly.

Example usage:
```
a = "hello";
b = "wóóórld!";
c = a + " " + b; // "hello wóóórld!"
```

### Regex
Regex data type exists for advanced string matching. It is defined using the `r"..."` literal *(a string literal prefixed with `r`)* and treated as PCRE (Perl-compatible) regular expressions *(the same as within PHP itself)* with Unicode mode enabled.

Example usage:
```
a = "facebook";
b = r"[o]{2}.*";
c = a == b; // true
```

### Array
Arrays are untyped *(PHP-style)* containers that can accomodate multiple values of different *(or same)* types. Optionally, array index can be defined for a value. By default, integer index starting from the lowest index found (or from `0`) is used.

Example usage:
```
a = ["abc", 123, 4: true, false, r"[A-Z]+"];
// Resulting array: [0: "abc", 1: 123, 4: true, 5: false, 6: r"[A-Z]+"]
```

### Functions
Function is a value type that represents *a "unit" of some self-contained logic*. In Primi they have their own type and are treated as first-class citizens: they can be **stored inside variables** and **passed around** as such. Direct invocation of an anonymous function is supported, provided that the anonymous function's definition is enclosed in parentheses. A function *does capture* its surrounding variables.

Example usage:
```

// Traditional definition.
function sub(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

// A variable "sub" that holds the "sub()" function is now defined in current scope.
sub(1, 2); // Returns -1

// Storing a function value into a variable.
// Note: This is equivalent to the previous definition.
sub_2 = function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
};

// A variable "sub_2" that holds the "sub_2()" function is now defined in current scope.
sub_2(1, 2); // Returns -1

// Creating a function with alternative, short syntax.
// Note: This is equivalent all of the previous definitions.
sub_3 = (a, b) => {
    return a - b;
};

// A variable "sub_3" that holds the "sub_3()" function is now defined in current scope.
sub_3(1, 2); // Returns -1

// Creating and using an anonymous function directly.
// Using an alternative, short syntax.
((a, b) => {
    return a - b;
})(1, 2); // Returns -1

```

#### Chained functions
In addition to classical function invocation, Primi additionaly supports [Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax) as a way to call functions "on values". Essentially, it means that calling `foo(bar);` is ***equivalent*** to calling `bar.foo()`, or *- to provide an example with additional parameters -* that calling `foo(bar, 1, true, "something");` is ***equivalent*** to calling `bar.foo(1, true, "something")`.

#### Value-type based inference of called function name
When using chained function invocation, Primi **interpreter will try to find the most fitting function to call**. "Most fitting" meaning that when the client calls `bar()` function on a value having the `string` type, Primi will try to find and use the `string_bar()` first. If such function is not defined, only then will the interpreter use the original `bar()` function.

Consider this *a syntactic sugar* to make coding in Primi a bit more user-friendly. Because of this the user is able to call `"something".length()` on a string the same way as calling `[1, 2, 3].length()` on an array, even though there are in fact two separate functions `string_length()` and `array_length()` invoked behind the scenes.

## Operators
Plethora of well known operators can be used to **define relationships** between and/or affect various values. Different operators can have various effects on various data types, some of which are covered down below.

### Negation
- `!`
    - Negate the value located after this operator.
    - Examples:
        ```
        a = true;
        b = !a; // false
        c = !b; // true
        ```
### Assignment
- `=`
    - Assign some value to a variable.
    - Can also be used to insert values to values that support it (eg. arrays).
    - Examples:
        ```
        a = 1;
        b = "a word";
        c = false;
        d = r"regul[ar]+";
        e = ["x", "b": "z"];
        e["c"] = "x"; // e == ["x", "b": "z", "c": "x"]
        ```

### Addition and multiplication
- `+`, `-`
    - Perform addition (subtraction) of two values.
        - Numbers:
            - `+` Add two numbers.
            - `-` Subtract two numbers.
        - Strings:
            - `+` Concatenate two strings.
            - `-` Removes all occurences of the right side from the left side.
            - `-` **(when right side is a *Regex* value)** Removes all matches of the regex from the left side string.
    - Examples:
        ```
        a = 5 + "4" // (number) 9
        b = 5 - 4; // (number) 1
        c = "a word and number " + 5; // "a word and number5"
        d = "a word" + " and one more"; // "a word and one more"
        e = "a word" - "or"; // "a wd"
        f = "regular expressions" - r"regul[ar]+\s*"; // "expressions"
        ```
- `*`, `/`
    - Perform multiplication (division) of two values.
        - Numbers:
            - `+` Multiply two numbers.
            - `-` Divide two numbers.
    - Examples:
        ```
        a = 1 * 2; // 2
        b = 2 * "3"; // 6
        c = "3" * 4; // 12
        d = 5 / "4"; // 1.25
        e = 5 / 5; // 1
        f = "20" / 4; // 5
        ```

### Unary operations
- `++`, `--`
    - Will add/subtract `1` to a number and, **based on the operator's position**, will return the original *or* the new value.
    - Examples:
        ```
        a = 5;
        b = ++a;
        // a == 6, b == 6

        a = 5;
        b = a++;
        // a == 6, b == 5

        a = 5;
        b = --a;
        // a == 4, b == 4

        a = 5;
        b = a--;
        // a == 4, b == 5
        ```
